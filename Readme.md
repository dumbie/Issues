When you are walking into any problems, bugs, need help or have a great new feature in your mind for one of my applications you can create an issue on the [issues](https://github.com/dumbie/Issues/issues) page so I can try to help you out and get everything working as intended.

Please use labels to mark the project you are creating a new issue for to keep things organized and easier for me to locate.

Your message will be public so please prevent sharing personal information, if you would rather like to contact me privately you can contact me [here](https://contact.arnoldvink.com).
